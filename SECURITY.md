# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No     |

## Known Security Limitations

### Current Security Status

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This software is currently in development and has known security limitations. It is **NOT recommended for production use** without additional security measures.

### Identified Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Gremlin Query Injection

- **Risk Level**: High
- **Description**: The `import_graph_data` and `export_subgraph` tools construct Gremlin queries from user input with basic sanitization only
- **Impact**: Malicious queries could potentially:
  - Access unauthorized data
  - Modify or delete graph data
  - Cause denial of service
- **Mitigation**: Use only in trusted environments with validated input

#### 2. Resource Exhaustion

- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Description**: No connection pooling, rate limiting, or query timeouts
- **Impact**: Server could be overwhelmed by:
  - Rapid successive requests
  - Long-running queries
  - Connection exhaustion
- **Mitigation**: Deploy behind a proxy with rate limiting

#### 3. Information Disclosure

- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- **Description**: Detailed error messages may expose internal system information
- **Impact**: Error responses could reveal:
  - Database schema details
  - Internal server structure
  - Configuration information
- **Mitigation**: Configure appropriate log levels in production

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed

Instead, please report security issues by:

**Email**: security@your-domain.com (replace with actual email)

**GitHub**: Create a private security advisory via GitHub's Security tab

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Your assessment of the potential impact
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: Any suggestions for fixing the vulnerability (optional)

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Release and Disclosure**: Within 6 weeks of initial report

### Vulnerability Handling Process

1. **Receipt Confirmation**: We'll confirm receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 1 week
3. **Investigation**: Our team will investigate and validate the issue
4. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on timing for public disclosure
6. **Release**: We'll release the fix and publish a security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using this software:

- **Environment**: Use only in trusted, controlled environments
- **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewalls with restricted access
- **Authentication**: Use strong credentials for Gremlin server connections
- **Monitoring**: Monitor query patterns and resource usage
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies and the software updated
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs before processing

### For Contributors

When contributing code:

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: All security-related changes require thorough review
- **Testing**: Include security test cases for new features

## Security Roadmap

We are actively working on improving security with these planned enhancements:

### Short Term (Next Release)

- [ ] Enhanced query sanitization and validation
- [ ] Improved error handling to prevent information disclosure
- [ ] Basic rate limiting implementation

### Medium Term (Next 2-3 Releases)

- [ ] Connection pooling with proper timeout handling
- [ ] Query allowlisting for production environments
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Security-focused configuration options

### Long Term (Future Releases)

- [ ] Advanced query analysis and blocking
- [ ] Integration with security scanning tools
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] End-to-end encryption for sensitive operations

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit` and `audit-ci` for known vulnerabilities
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint with security-focused rules
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode for memory safety

### Manual Security Testing

We perform regular manual security assessments including:

- Query injection testing
- Input validation testing
- Error handling verification
- Access control validation

### Security Tools Integration

We use the following tools for security monitoring:

- `npm audit` - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- `audit-ci` - CI/CD security gate
- GitHub Security Advisories - Vulnerability tracking
- Dependabot - Automated dependency updates
